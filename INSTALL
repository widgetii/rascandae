Installing instructions

Removing apache

You need to install rcconf to disable apache2 as just removing didn't work

$ sudo apt-get install rcconf

Then run it as root

$sudo  rcconf

and unselect apache2 from gui


You need to install supervisord virtualenv  packages

$ sudo apt-get install supervisor python-virtualenv 



SOMEHOW GET THE rascandae repository or copy of code


Then you need to copy supervisord.conf

$sudo cp ./support/rascandae.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/



This program depends on several python packages. And is supposed to be used with python virtualenv program


So basically you should create virtualenv

Inside rascandae folder

/rascandae $ virtuaenv venv

Then you should activate it

$ source venv/bin/activate

Then install necessary packages listed in requirements.txt

$ pip install -r requirements.txt


Use sudo crontab -e -u pi to edit crontable

add line

*/20 *  *    *   *    /home/pi/rascandae/cron.sh

To check for images every 20 minutes


Reboot. All should be working


Additional. Something appears to be listening on 9001 port so if you want supervisor web interface change port in /etc/supervisor/supervisor.conf

By adding following two lines

[inet_http_server]         ; inet (TCP) server disabled by default
port=127.0.0.1:9222
